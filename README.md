&emsp;She's fast, usefull when chasing! <br>
&emsp;She's strong, like she's using a netherite sword! <br>
&emsp;She's immortal! (Unless you use commands or attack her in creative!) <br>

# How to use it?
First, you need to paste the root folder `monikai` into your world's datapacks folder <br>
Then, you have to copy/move the `generated` folder into your world, using the structure block you can load the structure `s_monikai` <br> 
Finally, use the command `/forceload` to keep the chunks the structure is located loaded <br>
(The structure size is one chunk wide, you may need to make it fit perfectly if you just want to force 1 chunk, but that does not matters) <br>

# How does Monika works?
Simply enough, she's a wolf, you can actually see it when setting your gamemode to spectator, you'd have to tame it to make Monika yours! <br>
In the machine you can choose the button "Create By Player" in the case you have a secondary account joining the world with the name "Monika" <br>
you won't be able to control the player, because she will be acting according to the datapack<br>
<br>
In the case you can't or you don't want to do that for any reason, you can choose "Create By Model", which will use an armor stand <br>
